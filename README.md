# Project description
The data is the new raw material. However, the raw data itself is of negligible value, needs to be filtered and evaluated. For this reason, the professional management of information and data will be a central tool in the coming decades. Visual Genome presents a solution for the analysis and interpretation of human genomes. With the data as raw material and the use of new technologies, the solution allows to obtain as result an interactive and comprehensible report that contains a valuable collection of relevant biological data ready to be presented in a simple way to the user who does not have knowledge in genetics. These reports have associated risk markers for genetic diseases. In addition, it allows to consult the complete list of genomic variants identified in the process, which are used to present statistics and additional clinical information.
Visual Genoma facilitates access to genetic data in a clear and understandable way that stands out from the rest of the solutions in the market, while providing information of high technical content, allowing personalized or genomic medicine to be closer to the cure of diseases (cancer, diabetes) its prevention and awareness.
